# Widget-Minimalisation
A low power, efficent, simple, widget app, with simply a digital clock and a smiley face. ^_^
<p> Thats basically it, change it as much as you want, edit the source and do whatever, its a super light widget. Also just saying, this was compiled using nuitka, and the tkinter library was used!</p>
